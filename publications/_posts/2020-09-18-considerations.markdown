Non-face-to-face consultation, which ensures physical distance between patients and doctors, is increasing as a substitute mode for dealing with highly infectious diseases. Korea, with its remarkable Information and Communications Technology infrastructure, introduced telemedicine in 1988, yet it has not been formally accepted owing to stakeholders' resistance and legal restrictions.

The authors present a unique case of Korea where telemedicine, despite its solid technological base, has not yet gained a foothold 32 years after its first pilot project.
